Objective:
To build a machine learning regression model that predicts store sales based on historical patterns, promotions, holidays, and time-related features.

Dataset:
Source: Kaggle – Store Sales Time Series Forecasting
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting

Files used:
train.csv
holidays_events.csv

Note:
The dataset file train.csv is not uploaded due to GitHub size limitations.
Instructions to download and reproduce results are provided inside the project README.

Key Steps Performed:
1.Feature engineering (year, month, day, weekday, promotion, holiday).
2.Data preprocessing.
3.Training regression model.
4.Model evaluation using MAE and RMSE.
5.Interpretation of feature importance.

Outcome:
Developed a supervised regression model capable of predicting sales based on learned historical patterns.
