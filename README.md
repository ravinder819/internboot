Internboot Internship Projects:

Overview:
This repository contains three projects completed during my internship at Internboot, covering data analysis, machine learning, and deployment. Each project focuses on a different stage of the data science workflow.

Projects Included:

Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project focuses on understanding historical store sales data through data cleaning, merging datasets, and visualization to identify trends, seasonality, and the impact of promotions and holidays.
Folder: Project_1_EDA

Project 2: Store Sales Prediction (Regression)
In this project, a machine learning regression model was built to predict store sales using historical data and time-based features such as year, month, weekday, promotions, and holidays.
Folder: Project_2_Regression

Project 3: Sales Prediction Web Application
This project demonstrates deployment of a trained machine learning model using Flask, providing a web interface where users can input parameters and get sales predictions.
Folder: Project_3_Deployment

Technologies Used:
